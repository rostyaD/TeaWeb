        name: '"English Breakfast"',
        info: 'English breakfast tea or simply breakfast tea is a traditional blend of black teas originating from Assam, Ceylon and Kenya. It is one of the most popular blended teas, common in British and Irish tea culture. English breakfast tea is a black tea blend usually described as full-bodied, robust, rich and blended to go well with milk and sugar, in a style traditionally associated with a hearty English breakfast.',
        recipe: 'HOT: \n1. Heat water between 95-100 celsius degree; \n2. Steep tea for three to five minutes; \n3. Add milk and sugar to taste;',
        history: 'Accounts of its origins vary. Drinking a blend of black teas for breakfast is a longstanding British and Irish custom. The term breakfast tea has been applied by vendors since at least the late 18th century. \nDespite strong evidence for a Scottish origin, the blend became popular as an "English" breakfast tea. The current naming practice is claimed to have originated not in England but America, as far back as Colonial times. \nAn additional account (referencing a period-era Journal of Commerce article) dates the blend to 1843 and a tea merchant named Richard Davies in New York City. Davies, an English immigrant, started with a base of Congou and added a bit of Pekoe and Pouchong. It sold for 50 cents per pound (0.45 kg) (equivalent to $14.54 per pound in 2021), and its success led to imitators, helping to popularize the name. \nAn investigation to find the original Journal of Commerce article failed to locate it but did come upon an earlier reference to the same story in an 1876 edition of the Daily Alta California, citing "a New York commercial journal" and dating the teas origin to 1844. In an 1884 American publication it was noted that "Bohea teas (are) known to trade in this country as English Breakfast tea, from its forming the staple shipment to England".\nIn the UK, the popularisation of breakfast tea has been attributed in part to Queen Victoria. At Balmoral in 1892 she tasted and enjoyed a blend so-named and returned to London with a supply.',

        name: 'MILK OOLONG',

Oolong tea comes from the camellia sinensis plant which falls in-between green and black tea in oxidation and may display characteristics of both.\n Milk oolong is typically lightly oxidized and roasted, which helps retain the delicate floral aroma and creamy flavor. When we refer to milk oolong, weâ€™re talking about Taiwanese tea from the Jin Xuan (pronounced jin shuan) cultivar.\n\n It is known for its naturally light and creamy aftertaste with a rich body, hence the name. It is a very popular tea due to the appealing flavor and aroma. It does not, however mean the tea was processed with milk in any way. Dairy should be in the name only, and not in the ingredients. ',
